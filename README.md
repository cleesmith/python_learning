Learning Python
===============

A lot of this code is __half-baked__, all too often, from blogs/tutorials/such.

### picamera

Mostly this is about learning how to use picamera. To create a working
motion detector which uses tcp to stream images to another server.
This will avoid creating/deleting images on the sd card.
Note that this setup is **not very secure**, but hey, I'm mostly watching 
a cat that's prowling around for food.

### scapy

Looks interesting to work alongside snort.

### multiprocessing

Read that as **fork**, but it still looks useful if one remains
mindful of the consequences of launching too many children.
