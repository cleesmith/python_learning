Learning Python
===============

## Learning python by example from blogs/tutorials

### picamera

Mostly this is about learning how to use picamera. To create a working
motion detector which uses tcp to stream images to another server.
This will avoid creating/deleting images on the sd card.

### scapy

Looks interesting to work alongside snort.

### multiprocessing

Read that as **fork** looks useful.
