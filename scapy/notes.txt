Installing Scapy for Mac OS X
Dec 11th, 2013 | COMMENTS
What is Scapy?

Scapy is a tool, written in Python, for manipulating network packets. 
It can be used for capturing packets, forging them and decoding them. 
And that is just the tip of the iceberg, there are also a lot of other 
network related tasks that Scapy can handle, but that is out of the scope for this tutorial. 
For now, lets just focus on getting Scapy installed and running!

Installation & Dependencies

Installing Scapy itself from sources is a pretty straightforward for all 
Unix-like operating systems, like Mac OS X in this case. 
Installing additional libraries/dependencies is another thing. 
Although they are usually easy to intall, but there might be quite a few 
of them to missing by default depending on your OS, but lets get back to that in a moment.

First make sure that you have Python installed (should be installed as default on Mac OS X), 
which you can do by running python --version in terminal.

Now you can download the latest version of scapy, unzip it and install it:

$ wget scapy.net
$ unzip scapy-latest.zip
$ cd scapy-2.*
$ sudo python setup.py install
And that is basically it… if you’re very lucky and have all the additional 
libraries and dependencies already installed for some reason. 
Which in my case weren’t installed.
So trying to run Scapy for the first time gave me a bunch of info notifications 
and errors about missing libraries and modules:

$ scapy
INFO: Can't import python gnuplot wrapper . Won't be able to plot.
INFO: Can't import PyX. Won't be able to use psdump() or pdfdump().
ERROR: Unable to import pcap module: No module named pcap/No module named pcapy
ERROR: Unable to import dnet module: No module named dnet
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/scapy", line 25, in <module>
    interact()
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/scapy/main.py", line 278, in interact
    scapy_builtins = __import__("all",globals(),locals(),".").__dict__
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/scapy/all.py", line 28, in <module>
    from route6 import *
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/scapy/route6.py", line 267, in <module>
    conf.route6 = Route6()
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/scapy/route6.py", line 29, in __init__
    self.resync()
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/scapy/route6.py", line 42, in resync
    self.routes = read_routes6()
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/scapy/arch/unix.py", line 150, in read_routes6
    lifaddr = in6_getifaddr()
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/scapy/arch/unix.py", line 126, in in6_getifaddr
    i = dnet.intf()
NameError: global name 'dnet' is not defined
By looking at the ‘NameError’ on the last line I figured that I should probably 
install at least the ‘dnet’ module in order to be even able to run Scapy 
(which I later noticed in the Scapy installation docs also). 
So if you encounter the same issue, here’s how to get past that:

Edit: on Mac OS X you also need to have Xcode and its Command Line Tools 
installed in order to build ‘dnet’ from sources, because running make command uses gcc compiler. Make sure to have those installed before proceding to the next part!

$ wget http://libdnet.googlecode.com/files/libdnet-1.12.tgz
$ tar xfz libdnet-1.12.tgz
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ cd python
$ sudo python setup.py install
Next thing is to install the ‘pcap’ module to get rid of the other ‘ERROR’ line:

$ wget http://dfn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/pylibpcap/pylibpcap-0.6.4.tar.gz
$ tar xfz pylibpcap-0.6.4.tar.gz
$ cd pylibpcap-0.6.4
$ sudo python setup.py install
Now that the necessary modules were installed I tried to run Scapy again 
and for my delight all the errors were gone and Scapy was able to run. 
But there were still some info notifications about missing libraries that 
couldn’t be imported, which meant that all of the functionalities of Scapy would not work.

$ scapy
INFO: Can't import python gnuplot wrapper . Won't be able to plot.
INFO: Can't import PyX. Won't be able to use psdump() or pdfdump().
WARNING: No route found for IPv6 destination :: (no default route?)
INFO: Can't import python Crypto lib. Won't be able to decrypt WEP.
INFO: Can't import python Crypto lib. Disabled certificate manipulation tools
Welcome to Scapy (2.2.0)
>>>
So, more installing it is then..

Installing optional libraries

To get rid of the info notifications and to be able to use all of the nice 
features the following libraries need to be installed: gnuplot-py, pycrypto and PyX. 
And here’s how to do that.

Download and install the latest source of ‘gnuplot-py’ (1.8 during writing):

$ tar xfz gnuplot-py-1.8.tar
$ cd gnuplot-py-1.8
$ sudo python setup.py install
Download and install the latest source of ‘pycrypto’ (2.6.1 during writing):

$ wget http://ftp.dlitz.net/pub/dlitz/crypto/pycrypto/pycrypto-2.6.1.tar.gz
$ tar xfz pycrypto-2.6.1.tar.gz
$ cd pycrypto-2.6.1
$ sudo python setup.py install
Download and install the latest source of ‘PyX’ (0.12.1 during writing):

$ tar xfz PyX-0.12.1.tar.gz
$ cd PyX-0.12.1
$ sudo python setup.py install
All the necessities should be installed now and Scapy should run without 
any major errors or warnings (besides the warning about IPv6 route, but that’s 
because I haven’t set IPv6 on this machine). Enjoy your new toy.
